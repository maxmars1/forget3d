3. YOU CAN USE OUR SOFTWARE FOR GAMES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS

For Program and Updates, Hybrid hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, 
world-wide, non-transferable, revocable right and license for Licensee's own 
purposes:

    1. To load, run, store, transmit and execute the Program;

       is granted for Licensee to distribute the Program package in

       package

All subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

For avoidance of doubt, the following uses for Program are outside the
scope of this Agreement, requiring a separate commercial license:

    1. Selling or redistributing Program or any parts of Program for
       any other purpose than those specified above;
    2. Embedding, porting or integrating Program or parts thereof into

       and distributed within a mobile phone, PDA or any other such
       appliance or device;
    5. Modifying Program

As long as all of the conditions of this Agreement are fulfilled, Licensee 
may use Program for commercial Applications, for example develop and sell 
games which use Program.

Licensee shall not cause or permit any reverse-engineering or decompilation 
of the Program, except to the extent required for normal debugging and 
application development purposes.

The rights granted to Licensee in this Agreement are personal to Licensee, 
and may not be assigned or transferred to a third party without the previous 
written consent of Hybrid, except in the sale of substantially all of the 
assets of Licensee, for which no written consent of Hybrid shall be 
required.


4. WE'RE SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T PROMISE TO WORK FOR YOU WITHOUT PAY.
   WE'LL BE GLAD TO HELP IF TIME PERMITS, THOUGH.

Hybrid is not obligated to provide Licensee any support and maintenance, 
training, integration, optimization or any other services under this 
Agreement.


5. YOU STILL DON'T GET TO OWN OUR SOFTWARE...

This Agreement gives Licensee only limited license to use the Program. 
Hybrid solely retain all right, title and interest including but not limited 
to all Intellectual Property Rights to the Program, new versions, upgrades, 
updates, modifications, enhancements or copies thereof and all related 
documentation. All rights, titles and interest shall at all times remain 
solely the property of Hybrid.

Subject to the terms specified below, Hybrid warrants that the marketing, 
licensing of and use of the Program in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement shall not infringe any copyright, patent or registered design 
rights enforceable in Finland of any third party.

Hybrid shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based upon use 
of a superseded or altered release of the Program if such infringement would 
have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Program 
that Hybrid provides to Licensee.

In the defense or settlement of any claims, Hybrid shall have the option to 
(a) modify the Program so it becomes non-infringing or (b) obtain for 
Licensee a license to continue using the Program or (c) terminate the 
license for the infringing Program.

The remedies provided in this Clause 4 shall be the sole remedies available 
for breach of the warranty contained in this agreement. Hybrid excludes all 
liability for breach of any other Intellectual property rights.


6. THERE IS NO WARRANTY, SO IF YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE TO SHOOT YOURSELF
   IN THE FOOT IT'S NOT *OUR* FAULT.

Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or 
implied, including without limitation, any warranty of merchantability and 
fitness for a particular purpose.

Hybrid does not warrant the Program and/or Documentation will meet 
Licensee's requirements, nor that the operation of the Program will be 
uninterrupted or error free, nor that any errors will be corrected.

Licensee acknowledges that Hybrid has no control over licensee's use or 
exploitation of the program. Licensee therefore agrees to indemnify and hold 
Hybrid harmless against any costs, claims, demands, expenses and liabilities 
of whatsoever nature by any third party arising from such use or 
exploitation.

In no event shall Hybrid be liable for any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to 
use the program, even if Hybrid has been advised of the likelihood of such 
damages occurring. Hybrid shall not be liable for any loss, damages or 
costs, arising out of, but not limited to, lost profits or revenue, loss of 
use of the program or the media, loss of data or equipment, the costs of 
recovering the program, the media, data or equipment, the cost of substitute 
program, media, data or equipment or claims by third parties, or other 
similar costs.


7. SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND ASSOCIATED LEGALESE THEREWITH

In the event any provision or part thereof of this Agreement is held to be 
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions and parts of this 
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall 
not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.

Licensee will not export, directly or indirectly, the Program, Documentation 
or any direct product thereof or any technical data relating to the Program 
without complying with all regulations relating to such export issued by the 
local government.

Any public announcement by either party regarding this Agreement or uses of 
Program licensed under this Agreement by Licensee needs to be approved by 
both Parties in advance in writing.

Headings have been included for convenience only and shall not be used in 
constructing any provision of this Agreement.

This Agreement and all matters arising out or relating to this Agreement 
shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Finnish law. The 
parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of 
Finland. However, in the event of any dispute between Licensee and Hybrid 
under this Agreement, the parties agree that they shall negotiate with each 
other in good faith in an attempt to resolve the dispute prior to any 
commencement of proceedings.

I acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding 
obligation on the part of the Licensee.
